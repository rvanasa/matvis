# matvis

Finally...it's here...a way to actually visualize and understand matrix multiplication.

This is a very, very new project, so right now I just have a few scripts to render the following:

    matvis2 - basic 2D rotations with imaginary offset ring
    matvis2i - 2D rotations with an imaginary projection along the Z axis
    matvis2ni - N-dimensional rotations flattened into 2D with an imaginary Z axis
    matvisni - N-dimensional rotations flattened into 3D with imaginary offset points

Note: real numbers are blue, while imaginary points show up as orange. 

I'll be adding new concepts/features as time goes on. Have fun!
